## plants-csharp

This solution is set up to work with .NET 4.0 by default so that it can be opened with Visual Studio 2010, 2012, or 2013.  **Note: Visual Studio 2010 supports .NET 4.0 or lower.  Visual Studio 2012 and 2013 support .NET 4.5 and lower.**

If you would like to utilize .NET 4.5:
  1. Right-click on the `Library` project and go to `Configuration Properties->General->Platform Toolset` and change `Visual Studio 2010 (v100)` to `Visual Studio 2013 (v120)`.  
  2. Right-click on the `Plants` project and go to `Application->Target Framework` and change `.NET Framework 4.0` to `.NET Framework 4.5`.  
  3. Rebuild the solution and you're good to go.
